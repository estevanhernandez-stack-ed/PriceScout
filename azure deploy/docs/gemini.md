DEVELOPER PROFILE:
- Company: 626labs LLC (Aug 2025 - present)
- Quality standard: A grade (94-100/100), production-ready
- Testing: 95%+ coverage target
- Timeline: 2.5 months from start to 5 production apps
- Philosophy: Zero overhead, bootstrap, professional quality

CURRENT PROJECT:
- Flask QR code generator (single-page app)
- Branded QR codes → printable stickers
- Early stage, needs production hardening

HELP ME WITH:
[Choose: assessment | deployment | features | valuation | refactoring]

CONTEXT: I shipped a $85K-$125K theater pricing app in 2.5 months with 97.4% test coverage. I expect the same quality here, scaled appropriately for project complexity.

I'm working on a Python Flask application for generating branded QR codes that can be printed as stickers. It's currently a simple single-page app. I need you to help me develop this with the same quality standards I use for all my projects.

COMPANY CONTEXT:
- Company: 626labs LLC (founded August 10, 2025)
- Portfolio: 5 production-ready applications
- Development philosophy: Near-zero overhead, bootstrapped, high-quality code
- Quality standard: Grade A (94-100/100), production-ready from day one

PROJECT STANDARDS YOU MUST FOLLOW:
1. Code Quality: Aim for 94-100/100 grade (clean architecture, proper error handling)
2. Testing: Target 95%+ test coverage with pytest
3. Security: Production-grade from the start (input validation, CSRF protection, secure file handling)
4. Documentation: Comprehensive (README, API docs, deployment guide)
5. Version Control: Semantic versioning (v1.0.0 format)
6. Deployment Ready: Should be deployable to production immediately

TECHNICAL PREFERENCES:
- Python 3.11+
- Flask for web framework
- SQLite for simple data needs (or PostgreSQL if scaling needed)
- pytest for testing
- Clear separation of concerns (routes, business logic, templates)
- Environment-based configuration (.env files)
- Proper logging (not print statements)

CURRENT PROJECT STATE:
- Single-page Flask app
- QR code generation functionality
- Branding capability (logos/styling)
- Output: Printable stickers

Please analyze the current codebase and suggest improvements to bring it to production-grade A-level quality. Focus on: security, testing, architecture, and deployment readiness.
